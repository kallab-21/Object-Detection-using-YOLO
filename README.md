# Object-Detection-using-YOLO

The Objective of this project is to detect of objects using You Only Look Once (YOLO) approach. This method has several
advantages as compared to other object detection algorithms. 
Inother algorithms like Convolutional Neural Network, FastConvolutional Neural Network the algorithm will not look at the
image completely but in YOLO the algorithm looks the image
completely by predicting the bounding boxes using convolutional
network and the class probabilities for these boxes and detects the
image faster as compared to other algorithms
